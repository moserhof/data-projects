    "# Hacker News Profile - Ask HN VS Show HN\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News (HN) is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. HN is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can garner hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an avid reader of Hacker News, I wanted to analyze posts with titles **Ask HN** & **Show HN** to better understand engagement on this platform, which continues to be a thought catalyst with considerable influence in the tech sector writ large.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "- Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "- Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting. Below are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "- Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "- Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",

    "1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
